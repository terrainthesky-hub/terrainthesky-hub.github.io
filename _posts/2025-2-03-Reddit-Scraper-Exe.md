I was interested in creating a Reddit scraper so I could get the news but not be tempted to mindlessly scroll on social media. So, I created a Reddit scraper that extracts
images, some videos, text posts, youtube links, and the top 5 comment threads (formatted) from 5 different subreddits. The exe saves the previous subreddit entries and how many posts you want.

Here it is in action:

When complete:

And some examples of what the results.html file looks like:
