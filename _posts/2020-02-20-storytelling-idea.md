# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

I'm interested in steam game statistics

What do you know about?

I have a huge history of gaming knowledge and watch speedrunning documentaries even!

What decisions do you face?

How I'm going to get data that represents steam gamers or speedrunners. What i'm going to do with that data once I get it, how i'm going to clean it and interpret it.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Yes, you can probably find where people who play what game are located!

2. Trend related to the news

Game releases and game companies doing certain things that upsets or pleases gamers is a regular occurance.

3. Who does that?

There might be demographic information involved, probably more about computer specs than persons though.

4. Answering a question people care about

Yeah, people are interested in what accomplishments or things are happening accross a spectrum of gamers.

5. Valuable to businesses

There's definitely information to be gotten that is valuable to businesses, such as sale prices and media coverage related to sales. People buying games they don't even play!

6. What's the most popular?

Definitely could do a player count online for certain games.


7. Cost/Money rankings

covered this part in valuable to business, but you could also see how much is costs to play a game based on computer specs. Could be challenging to try and categorize different computer specs in terms of cost.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

I'm not sure, there's a lot of conceptions that i'd like to try and measure, like how the game development world is contract work and people are hired and fired based on projects.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

I saw one ds12 person do a measure of whether there was power creep in magic cards and I thought it was interesting how he weighted the values of the cards in terms of keywords. It's hard to turn card viability in game into a quantitative category.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

I think so.


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

You could see which card combinations were most popular based on the season.


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I think so.


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I found some stuff on kaggle from google.

Good ramen restaurants

What do you know about?

I know they always have wait times when they're good.

That restaurant quality ramen is anything like instant ramen.

One of the ds12 cohort did a michellin restaurant ratings data analysis and I thought it was interesting.

I want to know about wait times in relation to quality.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Probably.


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Yes


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I would have to assemble the data myself or narrow down certain restaurants in a larger dataset.
