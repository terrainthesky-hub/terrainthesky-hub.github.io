Hi,
  
I've been working hard on my coding question abilities, working on an array of easy questions on LeetCode so I can be competent in interviews and also for how useful it is to apply
data structures and algorithims to things like string manipulation--it's very useful for cleaning and manipulating data. I've also been working on learning Java so I have another language under
my belt besides Python. My next step is to apply what I've learned about Java to practical applications and back-end development. Check back soon to see what I've made!

  
Thanks!
