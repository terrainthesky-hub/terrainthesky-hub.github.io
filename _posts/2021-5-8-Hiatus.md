  Hi,
  
  In case you're wondering about me I had to take a break for health reasons but I am back and fully recovered! I'm currently working on a text adventure game to hone my
  Object Oriented Programming skills and after that I'm planning to take a course on AWS since that is a skill that seems to be high in demand. Come back soon to see what else
  I've done.
  
  Thanks!
