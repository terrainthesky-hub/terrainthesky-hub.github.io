title: Data Enginering for Human Rights Asylum Seeker PDFs
subtitle: data extraction of PDFs with Spacy NLP
---


[Human Rights First: Asylum Seekers](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/asylum) is a law firm that specializes in immigrants seeking asylum in the US. Our job was to make an app that could take in Asylum legal PDFs, extract important information, and add them to a database for users to search. I used pdfminer to scrape the PDFs for text and then used Spacy entity recognition and matching to to find the judges name in the PDF:

First, I used Spacy, and had to deal with names being written in a certain order i.e. George, J. Unfortunately, the judges name isn't always written in full on the PDFs, but I got around this by using a list of judges and their appointees and checking if that name was in the list of judges. I found that the judge name was always the first one written so I looped through the judge list to see if that name is in the list. After that, I created a dataframe with the judges full name from the judge list, and returned the first index in that dataframe to get the the judges full name.
